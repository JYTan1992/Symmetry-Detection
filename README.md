# Symmetry-Detection
Measured the health condition of the spine based on the symmetry of human back images. Used pattern recognition and machine learning techniques to detect the symmetry axis of human back image. Evaluated overall symmetry and labeled anomalies to aid medical diagnoses.
Self learned the SOFT algorithm and integrated it into the project for improving efficiency.
